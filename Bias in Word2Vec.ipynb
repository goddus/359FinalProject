    "Natural Language Processing is a branch of AI that focuses on getting machines to understand language as spoken by humans. The image below shows an example of a simple way to process language called document summarization. It takes a corpus of documents and calculates the frequency of different topics, based on the words that appear in the corpus. This is an easy way to determine general ideas presented in a corpus. But how do we get a machine to learn from what they read?\n",

    "As we explored briefly in the previous section, similarity is an abstract concept. What we think of when we say similarity does not entirely match the underlying mathematical similarity we compute. Word2Vec does not look at the context of the words on which it was trained on. Instead, it simply looks at associations between how often other words show up near the word we care about. For a more in depth look into how Word2Vec operates see this link about continuous bag of words (CBOW) and skip-gram: https://towardsdatascience.com/nlp-101-word2vec-skip-gram-and-cbow-93512ee24314\n",

As with this entire assignment, we don't actually know why we are seeing the number we are seeing - we have might have an idea or some worries, but we do not ultimately know. Is there a racial bias present amongst articles which discuss painters? Well, maybe, but we should not assume so based solely off what we present in this assignment. Word2Vec ignores context, so although black and white might be loosely associated with painter it is hard to tell if its because of race or simply the colors black and white with which painters work with all the time."

    "While the paper we are about to mention is far beyond the scope of this assignment, we wanted to relate something we all share - a name with something more scientific. No matter who you are, you probably know someone who has or you yourself have been adversely affected by your name. This paper https://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/E3635 talks about many forms of bias including stereotypes, but one section is dedicated to \"Top Asian (vs White) Adjectives over time by relative norm difference\". They were concerned about the differences over the course of different decades. What we want to highlight is the infinite amount of dimensions we have yet to think about when it comes to bias in word embeddings. While we use a specific corpus trained using a specific implementation of Word2Vec by gensim, we may or may not see certain forms of bias. \n",

Above we briefly motivated how machines just like we do (implicitly or explcitly) associate certain names with regions, ethnicities, race, gender, etc. In turn, we also associate all of these including name with certain steoreotypes or associations. So what if we take a list of adjectives which the paper cites on page 32 here: https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2018/03/30/1720347115.DCSupplemental/pnas.1720347115.sapp.pdf and test out two names, one traditionally Asian and one typically white?"
